//O(1) space, in-place, O((n+m)log(n+m)) time complexity
//how???
//picking up right location for element (from start or end) --> then putting the other element
//in its place will require some type of insertion sort algorithm...
//doing for all elements will take it to n^2 worst case when all elements in 1 are greater than in 2.
//if extra space is allowed --> O(m+n) simple solution exists
//log and sorted implies binary search but how?
